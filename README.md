# AsteroidProblem
 Some interesting exercise for repeating geometry

 You have discovered some asteroid, and you need to find out its coordinates (in this task, our coordinates are shrinked to 100x100x100).
 Also, you have some disposable probes that, when used, give you a distance to asteroid (without direction).
 The task it to use as few probes as possible to guarantee that you'll find the asteroid.
